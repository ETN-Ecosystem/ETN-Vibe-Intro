# ETN Vibe v1.1.2 Bug Fix Update 🚀

We are excited to announce version 1.1.2, focusing on stability, user experience, and seamless payment integrations. This update addresses key community feedback and improves the overall reliability of the platform.

## 🌟 Key Improvements

### ⚡ Seamless Navigation & Auth
*   **No More Unnecessary Redirects:** Fixed an issue where logged-in users were redirected to the login screen when trying to choose a plan. You can now navigate directly to pricing without interruption.
*   **Smarter Guest Handling:** The pricing page now intelligently adapts for guest users, inviting them to sign in only when ready to purchase.

### 💳 Real-Time Payment Confirmation
*   **Active Monitoring:** We've upgraded the "Pay with ETN" experience. Instead of a blind 15-second wait, the system now actively checks the blockchain for your transaction.
*   **Auto-Refresh:** As soon as your payment is confirmed, your dashboard checks in and updates your credits instantly—no manual refresh required!

### 🤖 Resilient AI Generation
*   **Improved Background Processing:** Creating a complex Vibe can take time. We've enhanced the generation wizard to handle longer processing times gracefully.
*   **Clearer Status:** If the AI needs a bit more time to craft your project, you'll now see a "Processing in Background" message instead of a confusing error, so you know your project is on its way.

### 🎨 Visual & Performance Polish
*   **Consistent Typography:** Resolved a font loading issue to ensure the custom ETN typography renders perfectly across all devices and browsers.
*   **Optimized Assets:** Improved how assets are loaded to prevent connection interruptions.

### 🔒 Enhanced Security
*   **Session Management Upgrade:** We've strengthened our authentication system with improved token management under the hood, ensuring your sessions remain secure and active when you need them.
